 <h1>3D simulation - Directions</h1>
 <hr>
 <p>
 The simulation demonstrates various properties of
 vector fields. You can select from a number of <a href="../Vector_field.html" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-text-blue w3-text-indigo">vector fields</a> and see how
 particles move in the field if it is treated as either a velocity
 or a force field.  This helps you visualise the field.
 <p>
 When you start the simulation, you will see 500 particles moving in the
 <tt>"1/r^2 single"</tt> field, which is a field that attracts
 particles to the center.  By default the
 particles are treating the field as a <b>velocity</b> field, which means
 that the field vectors determine how fast the particles are moving and in
 what direction.  In this case, the particles just move toward the center.
 The velocity of all the particles at a certain point
 on the grid is always the same.  If the field is a <b>force</b> field, then the
 field vectors determine the acceleration of the particles, but their velocity
 may vary depending on where they started.

<div class="w3-container">
<h2>Menu options</h2>
<p>
The <b>Field Selection</b> popup will allow you to select a
vector field. Here is a list of possible vector
fields: <a href="./functions3d.html" class="w3-btn w3-ripple w3-deep-purple" target="_blank">Functions (x,y,z)</a>

<p>
The <b>Display</b> popup will allow you to select how the field
is displayed:
<ul>
    <li><b>Display: Particles (Vel.)</b> means particles will move through
        the field, with the field vectors determining their velocity.
        Note that the particles are only a educational device
        intended to show what the field looks like; in real life, particles would not move in this manner.<p>
        <li><b>Display: Particles (Force)</b> means particles will move through
            the field, and the field vectors determine their acceleration.<p>
            <li><b>Display: Field Vectors</b> shows you the field vectors at an array
                of locations.<p>
                <li><b>Display: Streamlines</b> shows you the streamlines.  The
                    <b>Line Density</b> slider controls how many streamlines to draw.  The
                    color indicates the field strength.<p>
                    <li><b>Display: Equipotentials</b> shows you equipotential surfaces.
                        By default slicing is turned on because the equipotentials are easier
                        to see that way, and you can see more than one at a time.  <b><font color="red">Red</font></b> means
                        negative potential, <b><font color="green">green</font></b> means positive, <b><font color="gray">grey</font></b> means ground.  If you
                        turn slicing off, you can only see one equipotential at a time;
                        the <b>Potential</b> slider allows you to determine which one to
                        view.  If the slider is set too high or too low then the corresponding
                        equipotential surface may not be visible or may not exist, so just
                        play around with the slider a bit if you don't see anything.
                        </ul>
<p>
The <b>Mouse</b> popup controls what happens when you click on the box.
If you set it to <b>Adjust Angle</b> or <b>Adjust Zoom</b>, you can
adjust the orientation or size of the 3-d view by clicking and
dragging on the box.
<p>
The <b>Slice</b> popup allows you to look at planar slices of the box
rather than looking at the contents of the entire box.
If the popup is set to <b>No Slicing</b>, you view the entire
box.  Otherwise you will see the box sliced in one of three
directions.  The location of the slice can be adjusted by dragging
the line running along the sides of box near the slice.
<p>
The <b>Stopped</b> checkbox will stop the particles.
<p>
The <b>Reverse</b> checkbox will reverse the direction of all the
field vectors.
<p>
The <b>Reset</b> button can be used to reset the positions of
all the particles to random values.
<p>
The <b>Kick</b> button can be used to give all the particles a
random acceleration in some direction.
This is only allowed if the particle movement is set
to "Force".  It can be useful if none of the particles are moving,
or if they are all moving in the same direction.
<p>
The <b>Field Strength</b> slider makes the field stronger or weaker,
and also adjusts the brightness of the field vectors if you
have <b>Display: Field Vectors</b> selected.
<p>
The <b>Vector Density</b> slider controls the number of vectors present
if you have <b>Display: Field Vectors</b> selected.
<p>
The <b>Number of Particles</b> slider allows you to reduce the number
of particles, which can be useful if you want to watch the behavior of
just a few of them.  Also it might speed things up if you have fewer
particles.
<p>
A few additional field-specific sliders may be present,
depending on the field you have selected.
