 <h1>2D simulation - Functions</h1>
 <hr>
 <p>
 First some basic definitions: </p>
 <div class="w3-responsive">
 \begin{align*}
 &amp;\mathbf F=\left(F_1,F_2\right)=\nabla U=\mathbf i\,\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}+\mathbf j\,\frac{\partial U}{\partial y}=\mathbf u_r\,\frac{\partial U}{\partial r}+\mathbf u_{\theta}\,\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial U}{\partial \theta}\\
 &amp; \text{div} \,\mathbf F=\nabla\cdot\mathbf F=\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y}=\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial (rF_{1})}{\partial r}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial F_{2}}{\partial_{\theta}}\\
 &amp;\text{curl}\, \mathbf F=\nabla \times \mathbf F=\left(\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y}\right)\mathbf k=\frac{1}{r}\left[\frac{\partial (rF_{2})}{\partial r}-\frac{\partial F_1}{\partial_{\theta}}\right]\mathbf k
 \end{align*}
 </div>
 <hr>
 <p>
Next, here is a list of all the vector fields in this simulation: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>1/r single line</b>:
         This field is the electric field around an infinitely long line of
         charge.  It is inversely proportional to the distance from the line.
    <div class="w3-responsive">
         \begin{align*}
         &amp;\mathbf F=-\frac{\mathbf u_r}{r}=-\frac{\mathbf r}{r^2}=\left(-\frac{x}{x^2+y^2},-\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}\right)\quad(r\neq0)\\
         &amp; U= -\log r\quad(r\neq0)\\
         &amp;\nabla \cdot \mathbf F=0\\
         &amp; \nabla \times \mathbf F=0
         \end{align*}
    </div>
         This is a two-dimensional cross section of a three-dimensional field.
         In three dimensions, the divergence of this field is nonzero; but in
         this cross section, the divergence is zero everywhere except the
         origin.  (It is important to realize that the two-dimensional
         divergence of a field can be different than its three-dimensional divergence.)<p>
         
<li><b>1/r double lines</b>:
             This is the field around two infinitely long conductors.  The distance
             between them is adjustable.

<li><b>1/r^2 single</b>:
                 This field is associated with gravity and electrostatic attraction.
                 The gravitational field around a planet and the electric field
                 around a single point charge are similar to this field.
                 The field points towards the origin and is inversely proportional
                 to the square of the distance from the origin.
         <div class="w3-responsive">
         \begin{align*}
                 &amp;\mathbf F=-\frac{\mathbf u_r}{r^2}=-\frac{\mathbf r}{r^3}=\left(-\frac{x}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}},-\frac{y}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}\right)\quad(r\neq0)\\
                 &amp; U= \frac{1}{r}\quad(r\neq0)\\
                 &amp;\nabla \cdot \mathbf F=\frac{1}{r^3}\\
                 &amp; \nabla \times \mathbf F=0
                 \end{align*}
        </div>
This is a two-dimensional cross section of a three-dimensional field.
In three dimensions, the divergence of this field is zero except at
the origin; but in this cross section, the divergence is positive everywhere (except at the origin, where it is negative).

<li><b>1/r^2 double</b>:
                     This field is associated with gravity and electrostatic attraction.
                     The gravitational field around two planets and the electric field
                     around two negative point charges are similar to this field.
                     The separation of the two centers is adjustable.
<li><b>1/r rotational</b>:
         In this field, the particle is being pulled in a circle around the
         center.  The speed of its motion is inversely proportional to its
          distance from the line.  This is the magnetic field of an infinitely
          long current-carrying wire.
           </br>
        The divergence of this field is zero everywhere as we would expect
        for a magnetic field.  Surprisingly, the curl is also zero everywhere
        except at the origin, even though the particles are clearly moving in a circle.
         To see why, set the particle movement to "Curl Detectors".  You can see that even though the particles are moving in a circle, the particles themselves
                         are not turning.  This is because the force on the far side of the
                         particles (the side away from the center) is slightly weaker than
                         the force on the near side; this is just enough to cause the particles
                         to turn slightly in the opposite direction of the force.  This
                         counterbalances the rotation caused by the circular motion of the
                         particles.  So, the particles remain pointed in the same
                         direction as they go around in a circle.
                         </br>
                         Since the curl is nonzero at the origin, we cannot come up with a potential
                         function for this field.
                  <div class="w3-responsive">
                         \begin{align*}
                         &amp;\mathbf F=-\frac{\mathbf u_{\theta}}{r}=\frac{1}{r^2}(-y,x)=\left(-\frac{y}{x^2+y^2},\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\right)\quad(r\neq0)\\
                         &amp;\nabla \cdot \mathbf F=0\\
                         &amp; \nabla \times \mathbf F=0
                         \end{align*}
                    </div>
<li><b>1/r rotational potential</b>:
              This field is an attempt to represent the inverse rotational field
              using a potential.  Because of the discontinuity at the center,
              this is the best we can do.  We come close to the inverse rotational
              field except that there is a line at the top which the particles
              cannot cross.
            <div class="w3-responsive">
              \begin{align*}
              &amp; U=\theta\quad(\theta\neq0)\\
              &amp;\mathbf F=-\frac{\mathbf u_{\theta}}{r}=\frac{1}{r^2}(-y,x)=\left(-\frac{y}{x^2+y^2},\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\right)\quad(r\neq0)\\

              &amp; \nabla \times \mathbf F=0
               \end{align*}
            </div>
<li><b>1/r rotational double</b>:
              Here we have two centers of rotation, with an adjustable distance
              between them.
<li><b>1/r rotational double + ext</b>:
              Same as above, but a constant external field is added in.
              The strength and angle of the external field is adjustable.
<li><b>1/r rotational dipole</b>:
              Here we have two centers of rotation, with rotation in
              opposite directions, with an adjustable distance between them.
<li><b>1/r rotational dipole + ext</b>:
              Same as above, but a constant external field is added in.
              The strength and angle of the external field is adjustable.
              (In fluid dynamics this field is called the <a href="https://josvg.home.xs4all.nl/VDG/lamb-dip.html" target="_blank" class="w3-text-indigo w3-hover-text-blue">Lamb dipole</a>).
<li><b>one direction</b>:
              This is a very simple field where the field vectors are pointing
              in the same direction everywhere with the same magnitude.
              \begin{align*}
              &amp;\mathbf F=a\,\mathbf i=(a,0)\\
              &amp; U=a\,x\\
              &amp;\nabla \cdot \mathbf F=0\\
              &amp; \nabla \times \mathbf F=0
              \end{align*}
<li><b>1/r^2 sphere</b>:
             This field is associated with gravitation.
             Consider the gravitational field around a planet.
             Outside the planet, the field acts as if the planet were a point
             mass; the field is inversely proportional to the square of the
             distance from the center of the planet.  Inside the planet, the
             field is linear to the distance from the center of the planet.
             </br>
             Outside the planet:
             <div class="w3-responsive">
             \begin{align*}
             &amp;\mathbf F=-\frac{\mathbf r}{r^3}=\left(-\frac{x}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}},-\frac{y}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}\right)\quad(r\neq0)\\

             &amp; \nabla \times \mathbf F=0
             \end{align*}
            </div>
             Inside the planet (radius = <i>a</i>):
             <div class="w3-responsive">
             \begin{align*}
             &amp;\mathbf F=-\frac{\mathbf r}{a^3}=\left(-\frac{x}{a^3},-\frac{y}{a^3}\right)\quad(a\neq0)\\
             &amp; U=\frac{3}{2a}-\frac{r^2}{2a^3}\quad(a\neq0)\\
             &amp;\nabla \cdot \mathbf F=-\frac{2}{a^3}\\
             &amp; \nabla \times \mathbf F=0
             \end{align*}
              </div>
<li><b>const radial</b>:
            In this field, the particle is being pulled towards the center
            with a constant force no matter where it is.
            <div class="w3-responsive">
             \begin{align*}
             &amp;\mathbf F=a\,\mathbf u_r\\
             &amp; U=-a\,r\\
             &amp;\nabla \cdot \mathbf F=-\frac{a}{r}\quad(r\neq0)\\
             &amp; \nabla \times \mathbf F=0
             \end{align*}
             </div>
<li><b>linear radial</b>:
            In this field, the particle is being pulled towards the center
            with a force proportional to its distance from the center, similar
            to the force on an object attached to a spring.  This force
            looks more interesting when <b>Display: Particles (Force)</b> is
            used instead of a velocity field.
            <div class="w3-responsive">
\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathbf F=-k\,r \,\mathbf u_r\\
&amp; U=-\frac12 k\, r^2\\
&amp;\nabla \cdot \mathbf F=-2kr\\
&amp; \nabla \times \mathbf F=0
\end{align*}
</div>
<li><b>inverse to y axis</b>:
          There is a force
          towards the y axis inversely proportional to the distance.
          <div class="w3-responsive">
          \begin{align*}
          &amp;\mathbf F=-\frac{1}{x}\mathbf i\quad(x\neq0)\\
          &amp; U=\frac{1}{2x^2}\quad(x\neq0)\\
          &amp;\nabla \cdot \mathbf F=\frac{1}{x^2}\\
          &amp; \nabla \times \mathbf F=0
          \end{align*}
          </div>
<li><b>1/r^2 rotational</b>:
    In this field, the particle is being pulled in a circle around the
    center.  The speed of its motion is inversely proportional to the
    square of the distance from the center.
     </br>
    The curl of this field is nonzero everywhere as we might
    expect for a field that causes particles to rotate.  However,
    note that the curl is <i>negative</i> everywhere (except at the center);
    this means that the curl vector is in the negative z direction, which implies clockwise
    movement.  This is surprising, since the particles are clearly
    moving counter-clockwise.  To see why this is,
    set the particle movement to "Curl Detectors".  You can see that even
    though the particles are moving counter-clockwise, the particles themselves
    are turning very slowly in a <i>clockwise</i> direction.
    This is because the force on the far side of the
    particles (the side away from the center) is weaker than
    the force on the near side; this is enough to cause the particles
    to turn slightly in the opposite direction of the force.  This
    more than makes up for the counter-clockwise
    rotation caused by the motion of the particles.
    <div class="w3-responsive">
    \begin{align*}
    &amp;\mathbf F=-\frac{\mathbf u_{\theta}}{r^2}=\frac{1}{r^3}(-y,x)=\left(-\frac{y}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}},\frac{x}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}\right)\\
    &amp; \nabla \times \mathbf F=-\frac{\mathbf k}{r^3}\quad (r\neq 0)\\
    &amp;\nabla \cdot \mathbf F=0
    \end{align*}
    </div>
<li><b>pendulum potential</b>:
              Consider a pendulum which is free to move in both the $x$ and $y$ direction.
              We can describe its position using the angle it makes with the positive
              $x$ axis (theta) and the angle it makes with the $xy$ plane (phi).
              Its potential energy is determined by its height, which is equal to
              $h-l \cos(\text{theta}) \cos(\text{phi})$ where $l$ is the length of the pendulum and
              $h$ is the height of the support it is attached to.
              </br>
              If we replace theta with $x$ and phi with $y$, then we can graph the
              potential energy, and we can treat the force on the pendulum
              as a vector field, and see how particles act when placed in the
              vector field.
              </br>
              In the simulation, the angles range from $-\pi$ to $\pi$ ($-180^{\circ}$ to $180^{\circ}$).  The
              center of the graph is when both angles are zero and the pendulum
              is at rest.  If you
              set the particle movement to "Force", you can see the particles swing
              back and forth like a pendulum would.  You can see this better if you
              set the number of particles to a small number.
              </br>
              If you set the floor
              colors to "Potential", you can see a white line around the center
              red area; this is the point where one or both of the angles is at 90
              degrees; in this case the pendulum is at the same height as its support
              and it doesn't matter what the other angle is.  In the green areas,
              the pendulum is actually above its support.
              </br>
              Sometimes the particles
              manage to make it over the top of the hills on either side; this
              corresponds to a pendulum swinging up and over the top.
              <div class="w3-responsive">
              \begin{align*}
              &amp; U=\cos x\cos y\\
              &amp;\mathbf F=(-\sin x\cos y,-\cos x \sin y)\\
              &amp;\nabla \cdot \mathbf F=-2\cos x \cos y\\
              &amp; \nabla \times \mathbf F=0
              \end{align*}
              </div>
<li><b>user-defined potential</b>: this allows you to enter
an arbitrary potential function into a text box.  The field vectors
will be calculated from it.  A sample potential is <tt>x*x-y*y</tt>,
which is a saddle potential.  Here are some other sample expressions,
to give you an idea of the input format:
<div class="w3-margin-left">
<tt>
x+y</br>
-x^2+5.2*y</br>
2*sin(x)+3*y</br>
1000/(r^2)-5*y</br>
abs(x)</br>
exp(2*log(x+10))+sqrt(y+10)</br>
</tt></br>
</div>
After entering a new potential, press return so that the change
takes effect.  If nothing happens, then the field may be too weak; either
increase the field strength, or multiply the field by a large constant.
If particles jump around randomly with no apparent pattern, the field
may be too strong.
</br>
Each coordinate ranges from -10 to 10, so the edges of the view are at (&plusmn;10,&plusmn;10). The center of the view is the origin.
<li><b>user-defined field</b>: this allows you to enter
     an arbitrary field into text boxes (one for each coordinate).
    If you try to enter some of the predefined fields (like <tt>(x,x2)</tt>)
    keep in mind that the fields will not appear exactly the same,
    because many of the predefined
    fields have a constant scaling factor that isn't reflected in the name
    of the field.
</ul>
