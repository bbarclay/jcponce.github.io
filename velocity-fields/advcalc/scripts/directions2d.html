 <h1>2D simulation - Directions</h1>
 <hr>
 <p>
 This simulation demonstrates various properties of
 vector fields. You can select from a number of <a href="../Vector_field.html" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-text-blue w3-text-indigo">vector fields</a> and see how
 particles move in the field if it is treated as either a velocity
 or a force field.  This helps you visualise the field.  You
 can also see the values of the divergence and curl of the field.
 <p>
 When you start the simulation, you will see 500 particles moving in the
 <tt>"1/r single line"</tt> field, which is a field that attracts
 particles to the center.  By default the
 particles are treating the field as a <b>velocity</b> field, which means
 that the field vectors determine how fast the particles are moving and in
 what direction.  In this case, the particles just move toward the center
 and fall in.  The velocity of all the particles at a certain point
 on the grid is always the same.  If the field is treated as a <b>force</b>
 field, then the
 field vectors determine the acceleration of the particles, but their velocity
 may vary depending on where they started.
 <p>
 If the vector field is a gradient field then
 you will see the particles moving on a surface determined by the
 potential function associated with the field.  They will roll downhill
 on the surface.
 <p>
 If the vector field is not a gradient field, then you will just see
 a 2-dimensional view of the particles moving around in a grid.

<div class="w3-container">
<h2>Menu options</h2>
<p>
The <b>Setup</b> popup will allow you to select a
vector field.  Here is a list of possible vector
fields: <a href="./functions2d.html" target="_blank" class="w3-btn w3-ripple w3-deep-purple" >Functions (x,y)</a>
<p>
The <b>Color</b> popup will allow you to select what the
color of the floor means.  Generally the floor color will indicate
the value of some quantity at that point, where <b><font color="green">green</font></b> means positive,
<b><font color="gray">grey</font></b> means zero, and <b><font color="red">red</font></b> means negative.  Here are the possibilities:
<ul>
    <li><b>Field Magnitude</b> means the floor indicates the strength of the
        field.  It will be <b><font color="green">green</font></b> if the field is strong and <b><font color="gray">grey</font></b> if it is weak or not present.<p>
        <li><b>Potential</b> means the floor indicates the value of the potential
            function, if any.<p>
            <li><b>None</b> means the floor is <b><font color="gray">grey</font></b>.<p>
                <li><b>Divergence</b> means the floor indicates the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Divergence.html" class="w3-hover-text-blue w3-text-indigo">divergence</a> of
                    the field.<p>
                    <li><b>Curl Z</b> means the floor indicates the Z component of the
                        field's <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Curl.html" class="w3-hover-text-blue w3-text-indigo">curl</a>.  (The curl can't have any other components because the
                        field vectors are always in the x-y plane, and the curl must be
                        perpendicular to the field vectors.)  <b><font color="green">Green</font></b> means positive curl
                        (counter-clockwise rotation) and <b><font color="red">red</font></b> means negative curl (clockwise).
                        </ul>
<p>
The <b>Floor</b> popup allows you to select whether grid lines,
equipotentials, or streamlines are drawn on the floor, or none of the above.
<p>
The <b>Flat View</b> checkbox allows you to select a two-dimensional
view of the vector field rather than showing the particles on a
potential surface.  This is done automatically when viewing vector fields
which are not gradient fields, when viewing field vectors or curl
detectors, or when taking a line or surface integral.
<p>
The <b>Display</b> popup will allow you to select how
the particles will move:
<ul>
    <li><b>Display: Particles (Vel.)</b> means particles will move through
        the field, with the field vectors determining their velocity.<p>
        <li><b>Display: Particles (Force)</b> means particles will move through
            the field, and the field vectors determine their acceleration.<p>
            <li><b>Display: Field Vectors</b> shows you the field vectors at an array
                of locations.<p>
                <li><b>Display: None</b> doesn't show any particles or field vectors.
                    <li><b>Display: Curl Detectors</b> means the field will be treated as a velocity
                        field, but the particles will be little plus signs instead of dots,
                        so you can see if the field is making them rotate.  This can be used
                        to determine if the vector field has curl.
                        </ul>
<p>
The <b>Mouse</b> popup controls what happens when you click on the view.
If you set it to <b>Adjust Angle</b> or <b>Adjust Zoom</b>, you can
adjust the orientation or size of the 3d view by clicking and
dragging.
<p>
If you select <b>Line Integral</b> from the mouse popup, you can perform
a line integral by clicking and dragging out a rectangular area.  This will
show the circulation around that area.  It should be proportional to the
total curl inside, by <A
    href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GreensTheorem.html" class="w3-hover-text-blue w3-text-indigo">Green's
    theorem</a>.
<p>
If you select <b>Surface Integral</b> from the mouse popup, you can perform
a surface integral by clicking and dragging out a rectangular area.  This will
show the flux through the bounds of that area.  It should be
proportional to the total divergence inside, by
the <A href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivergenceTheorem.html" class="w3-hover-text-blue w3-text-indigo">divergence theorem</a>.
<p>
The <b>Stopped</b> checkbox will stop the particles.
<p>
The <b>Reverse</b> checkbox will reverse the direction of all the
field vectors.
<p>
The <b>Reset</b> button can be used to reset the positions of
all the particles to random values.
<p>
The <b>Kick</b> button can be used to give all the particles a
random acceleration in some direction.
This is only allowed if the particle movement is set
to "Force".  It can be useful if none of the particles are moving,
or if they are all moving in the same direction.
<p>
The <b>Field Strength</b> slider makes the field stronger or weaker,
and also adjusts the brightness of the field vectors if you
have <b>Display: Field Vectors</b> selected.
<p>
The <b>Vector Density</b> slider controls the number of vectors present
if you have <b>Display: Field Vectors</b> selected.
<p>
The <b>Number of Particles</b> slider allows you to reduce the number
of particles, which can be useful if you want to watch the behavior of
just a few of them.  Also it might speed things up if you have fewer
particles.
<p>
A few additional field-specific sliders may be present,
depending on the field you have selected.
